                  “The process of transforming pain is, literally, a day-by-day
                  project—sometimes minute by minute, sometimes even breath by
                  breath—accomplished by tolerating it, picturing it, describing
                  it, sharing it, exploring it, dreaming it, and learning to
                  swim in it.”<br />- Jeff Eaton

                  I specialize in a depth-oriented approach where the goal is to
                  create a space and place for you to know yourself more deeply.
                  This discovery process can include touching pain, beholding
                  beauty, and widening your imagination for hope in the context
                  of your story.
               </p>
               <p>
                  As a psychotherapist I believe my job is to accompany you on
                  the life-long process of self-discovery. To stand with you on
                  the shore, see what washes up, and hold each moment with
                  openness and curiosity.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Whether this is your first time considering psychotherapy or
                  you are looking for a new therapist, I know the process can
                  hold many feelings. You deserve someone and someplace where
                  you feel safe and comfortable to engage this work. I am
                  currently accepting new patients, so feel free to reach out to
                  me for more information or to schedule a session.

               <p>
                  I specialize in a depth-oriented, long-term, psychodynamic
                  approach. This means that I believe suffering and pain are
                  often more mysterious, complex, and elusive than traditional
                  medical models or even our own awareness might lead us to
                  believe.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Managing unpleasant symptoms is needed at times — a broken arm
                  requires a sling. But I believe that lasting change comes as
                  we begin to work with the deeper, unconscious structures that
                  form our persons.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This work will naturally lead us into areas such as early
                  childhood, relationships and sexuality, family of origin,
                  dreams, behavior patterns, or cultural contexts. In addition,
                  the relationship we build within the therapeutic process is
                  both active and alive, and will uniquely inform our work.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The therapy process requires an investment of your body, soul,
                  mind, and resources. I believe making time and space to invest
                  in yourself is a most valuable gift. The work you do will not
                  only serve you, but will ripple out into your relationships,
                  family, community, and future generations.
               </p>
               <p>
                  If you are suffering from anxiety, depression, panic attacks,
                  addiction, relationship issues, shame — whatever it is that
                  ails you — our work together can provide lasting and
                  meaningful change.

                  203, and you are welcome to wait in the chairs located at the
                  end of the hallway. The Fremont area can get backed up during
                  rush hour, or due to boat traffic, so plan accordingly.
                  Depending on the direction you are coming from, it may be a
                  good idea to use a route that avoids crossing the Fremont
                  bridge.
